Now that you’ve checked out to the new branch, well make some changes and see Git in action.
1.Open the README.md in your repository 
2.Add some content using your favorite text editor. 
3.When you’re finished, save your changes.

After you made some changes to your file, it’s time to create your first snapshot. When working from the command line, you will need to be familiar with the idea of the two stage commit.

When you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed. Git tracks these files, and keeps track of your history by organizing your files and changes in three trees. They are working, staging(also called index), and history. When we add, delete, and make changes to files, we do this in the working tree.
